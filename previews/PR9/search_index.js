If a given frequency is not exactly matching the Fourier frequencies, the closest one is removed.\n\nImportant: periods/frequencies are defined with respect to the t axis length, the actual t values are not used in this method. So, frequency 1/12 (a period of 12) means 12 data points (whose actual value depends on t).\n\nIf you provide s the method plans the forward and inverse Fourier transforms (so that it is efficient to re-use it for s of same type and length).\n\nThis method works well when a periodic signal P is superimposed on fluctuations S, and you have a good educated guess of what frequencies compose P. This method works well if the given signal has length multiple of the periods given.\n\nThere is arbitrarity of which part of the signal x, r gets the mean value of s, because it is deducted for a better fit.

It works for non-equispaced t axis (and also normal), is generally very accurate (if choosen frequencies are not too close), but has performance scaling of O(N^2.4) instead of O(n log(n)) of Fourier.\n\nBecause it can work with arbitrary signal length the method always estimates the zero-frequency Fourier component, and attributes it to x.

The method is method \"IV\" of [Grassberger1993].\n\nm::Int is the same as in [Grassberger1993], the embedding dimension - 1. Q is related with the expected dimension d of the manifold of the deterministic dynamics, with d = m-Q+1. If given a Vector{Int} as Q the algorithm will iteratively do noise reduction to the resulting outputs (thus a vector is strongly recommended). Duplicate entries can exist in Q.\n\nk can be either Int or a SearchType from Neighborhood.jl. If Int, the k nearest neighbors are choosen as the neighborhood 𝓤 of each point. The paper contains an involved process for determining optimal k::Int, see eq.(5.4). w is just the Theiler window, while r is the value of the edge entries of vector R, and probably has not much impact (the rest of the entries are 1).\n\nIn the paper too big correction vectors were rescaled to the average magnitude of corrections, using as a criterion the distribution of their size. This is not implemented here (as it is not clear exactly what it means computationally, what is \"too big\"?)

In short, we estimate r by minimizing a cost with two components: that x is close to s/r and that x is smooth. μ is the multiplier of the smoothness cost.\n\nYou can give a vector as μ.
