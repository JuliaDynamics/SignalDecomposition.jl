# Singular Spectrum Analysis
# Fredrik Bagge Carlson says:
# I have a package with similar aim here https://github.com/baggepinnen/SingularSpectrumAnalysis.jl
# and some notebooks
# https://github.com/baggepinnen/julia_examples/blob/master/identification_robust.ipynb

# When I write trend I mean a low-frequency component such as a linear trend or a slowly
# varying signal. The SSA package implements two different methods, one that is designed
# for Gaussian residuals, and one that is designed for sparse but very large residuals
