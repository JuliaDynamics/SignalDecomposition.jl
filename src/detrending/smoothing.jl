    MovingAverageSmoothing(window::Int = 10) <: Decomposition

Decompose timeseries `s` into a **sum** `x + r` where `x` is the smoothened signal
and `r` the residual. The smoothing is done via a basic moving average using a fixed
rectangualr window of size `window`.
At the end and start of teh timeseries only half of the window can be used for averaging.

"""
    LoessSmoothing(; span, degree, cell) <: Decomposition

Decompose timeseries `s` into a **sum** `x + r` where `x` is the smoothened signal
and `r` the residual. The smoothing is done via locally estimated scatterplot smoothing
(loess) using Loess.jl and the provided keywords.

- `span`: The degree of smoothing, typically in [0,1]. Smaller values result in smaller
  local context in fitting.
- `degree`: Polynomial degree.
- `cell`: Control parameter for bucket size. Internal interpolation nodes will be
added to the K-D tree until the number of bucket element is below `n * cell * span`.
