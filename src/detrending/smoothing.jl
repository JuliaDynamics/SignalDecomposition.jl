    MovingAverageSmoothing(window::Int = 10) <: Decomposition

Decompose timeseries `s` into a **sum** `x + r` where `x` is the smoothened singla
and `r` the residual. The smoothing is done via a basic moving average using a fixed
rectangualr window of size `window`.
At the end and start of teh timeseries only half of the window can be used for averaging.
