"""
    decompose([t, ] s, method::Decomposition) â†’ x, r
Decompose an 1D input signal or timeseries `s(t)` into components, `x, r`,
using the given `method`. `t` defaults to `1:length(s)`.

What are `x` and `r` really depend on your point of view and your application.
They can be structure `x` and noise `r` (i.e. noise reduction). They can be
seasonal/periodic `x` and residual component `r`. They can even be multiplier `x` and
input `r`.
