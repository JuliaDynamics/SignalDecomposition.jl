"""
    decompose([t, ] s, method::Decomposition) â†’ p, r
Decompose an 1D input signal or timeseries `s(t)` into its periodic and residual
components `p, r` using the given `method`. `t` defaults to `1:length(s)`.
Other common names for `p, r` are "seasonal" and "trend".

The decomposition is under addition, i.e. `s = p .+ r`, unless
explicitly noted otherwise by the `method`.
By convention, the periodic component also includes the mean value of `s`.
