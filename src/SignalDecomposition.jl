"""
    decompose([t, ] s, method::Decomposition) â†’ x, r
Decompose an 1D input signal or timeseries `s(t)` into two components,
the structure `x` and noise `r`. Depending on your application, "structure" could be
a seasonal/periodic uninteresting component, and "noise" a residual interesting component.
The decomposition is done via dispatch on the `method` (see the methods for more).

Most of the time `x` also includes the mean value of `s`.
