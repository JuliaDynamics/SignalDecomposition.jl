The method is method \"IV\" of [Grassberger1993].\n\nm::Int is the same as in [Grassberger1993], the embedding dimension - 1. Q is related with the expected dimension d of the manifold of the deterministic dynamics, with d = m-Q+1. If given a Vector{Int} as Q the algorithm will iteratively do noise reduction to the resulting outputs (thus a vector is strongly recommended). Duplicate entries can exist in Q.\n\nk can be either Int or a SearchType from Neighborhood.jl. If Int, the k nearest neighbors are choosen as the neighborhood 𝓤 of each point. The paper contains an involved process for determining optimal k::Int, see eq.(5.4). w is just the Theiler window, while r is the value of the edge entries of vector R, and probably has not much impact (the rest of the entries are 1).\n\nIn the paper too big correction vectors were rescaled to the average magnitude of corrections, using as a criterion the distribution of their size. This is not implemented here (as it is not clear exactly what it means computationally, what is \"too big\"?)
